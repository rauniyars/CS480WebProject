# Description: 
This project originates from the field of Bioinformatics and concerns the study of genes and their levels of activity in producing proteins that may likely be associated with disease-onset and cancer-initiation. We note that the study of gene expression data will provide important insight into which genes are responsible for the onset of particular types of disease. The knowledge of which particular genes are present and are being expressed during the initiation of disease will enable us to build a type of primitive profiling system which may be used in conjunction with other diagnostics for early detection. In order to make it convenient to work with numerous sets of data, we implemented the techniques of Machine Learning to help us detect signals within the data and eventually make decisions with minimal human intervention. Among the wide variety of algorithms and statistical models available in Machine Learning, that contribute to the art of pattern recognition, we used the Hierarchical Clustering Algorithm that works on the basic concept of a hierarchical tree that represents data in the form of nodes and each node in the tree contains similar data.
